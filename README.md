## 🛠️ Pipeline Overview

BrushEdit consists of four main steps: (i) Editing category classification: determine the type of editing required. (ii) Identification of the primary editing object: Identify the main object to be edited. (iii) Acquisition of the editing mask and target Caption: Generate the editing mask and corresponding target caption. (iv) Image inpainting: Perform the actual image editing. Steps (i) to (iii) utilize pre-trained MLLMs and detection models to ascertain the editing type, target object, editing masks, and target caption. Step (iv) involves image editing using the dual-branch inpainting model improved BrushNet. This model inpaints the target areas based on the target caption and editing masks, leveraging the generative potential and background preservation capabilities of inpainting models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Environment Requirement 🌍

BrushEdit has been implemented and tested on CUDA118, Pytorch 2.0.1, python 3.10.6.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/TencentARC/BrushEdit.git
```

We recommend you first use `conda` to create virtual environment, and install `pytorch` following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/). For example:

```
conda create -n brushedit python=3.10.6 -y
conda activate brushedit
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Then, you can install diffusers (implemented in this repo) with:

```
pip install -e .
```

After that, you can install required packages thourgh:

```
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### Download Checkpoints 💾

Checkpoints of BrushEdit can be downloaded using the following command.

```
sh app/down_load_brushedit.sh
```


**The ckpt folder contains**

- BrushNetX pretrained checkpoints for Stable Diffusion v1.5 (`brushnetX`)
- Pretrained Stable Diffusion v1.5 checkpoint (e.g., realisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)). You can use `scripts/convert_original_stable_diffusion_to_diffusers.py` to process other models downloaded from Civitai.
- Pretrained GroundingDINO checkpoint from [offical](https://huggingface.co/ShilongLiu/GroundingDINO/resolve/main/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth).
- Pretrained SAM checkpoint from [offical](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth).



The checkpoint structure should be like:

```
|-- models
    |-- base_model
        |-- realisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE
            |-- model_index.json
            |-- vae
            |-- ...
        |-- dreamshaper_8
            |-- ...
        |-- epicrealism_naturalSinRC1VAE
            |-- ...
        |-- meinamix_meinaV11
            |-- ...
        |-- ...
    |-- brushnetX
        |-- config.json
        |-- diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
    |-- grounding_dino
        |-- groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
    |-- sam
        |-- sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
    |-- vlm
        |-- llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-hf
          |-- ...
        |-- llava-v1.6-vicuna-13b-hf
          |-- ...
        |-- Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
          |-- ...
        |-- ...
      
```

We provide five base diffusion models, including:

- Dreamshapre_8 is a versatile model that can generate impressive portraits and landscape images.
- Epicrealism_naturalSinRC1VAE is a realistic style model that excels at generating portraits
- HenmixReal_v5c is a model that specializes in generating realistic images of women.
- Meinamix_meinaV11 is a model that excels at generating images in an animated style.
- RealisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE is a highly generalized realistic style model. 

The BrushNetX checkpoint represents an enhanced version of BrushNet, having been trained on a more diverse dataset to improve its editing capabilities, such as deletion and replacement.

We provide two VLM models, including  Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and LLama3-LLaa-next-8b-hf.  **We strongly recommend using GPT-4o for reasoning.**  After selecting the VLM model as gpt4-o, enter the API KEY and click the Submit and Verify button. If the output is success, you can use gpt4-o normally. Secondarily, we recommend using the Qwen2VL model.

And you can download more prefromhuggingface_hubimporthf_hub_download, snapshot_downloadtrained VLMs model from [QwenVL](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen2-vl-66cee7455501d7126940800d) and [LLaVA-Next](https://huggingface.co/collections/llava-hf/llava-next-65f75c4afac77fd37dbbe6cf).
